        <h1>Smart Revenue Systems</h1>
        <h2>SDG Target 11.3: Inclusive and Sustainable Urbanization</h2>
        <p>
            Indicator 11.3.2: Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically.
        </p>
        <p>
            Smart revenue systems ensure sustainable urban growth by funding better infrastructure and urban planning. They encourage public-private partnerships and create new revenue sources to support economic development.
        </p>

        <h3>Investment Management for City Revenue</h3>
        <p>
            The system models a demat account simulation for managing investments in city development projects. Investors can participate in various projects that contribute to the city's growth and infrastructure, enabling the city to become financially stable. The system allows users to check their balances, invest in projects, and track their investments.
        </p>

        <h3>System Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Investment Management:</strong> Users can invest in city projects and track their investments and profits.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance Tracking:</strong> Users can view their current balance, total investments, and profits.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Project Listings:</strong> A priority queue is used to display available investment projects, sorted by the amount of funding remaining.</li>
            <li><strong>Login and Registration:</strong> Secure login and registration system for users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Password Security</h3>
        <p>
            To ensure secure access to user accounts, the system uses a simple "shift by 1" rule for password encryption. This rule shifts each character in the password by one position in the ASCII table. For example, the character 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on. This is a basic form of encryption that adds a layer of security for storing and validating passwords.
        </p>

        <h3>Why This Challenge Matters</h3>
        <p>
            The smart revenue system ensures the city can attract investments for growth and infrastructure projects. By offering a transparent, user-friendly platform for investment, the city can engage citizens and private investors in its financial growth. This model can lead to more inclusive, sustainable urban development.

        </div>

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            The system uses a priority queue for managing investment projects, ensuring efficient retrieval of projects based on remaining funding. The time complexity of the investment process is O(log n), where 'n' is the number of projects. The system also employs simple map and queue structures for managing user data and login history, ensuring fast access and updates.
