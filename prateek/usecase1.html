        <p>Several advanced algorithms can optimize traffic management, and each has distinct applications. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shortest Path Algorithms</strong> (e.g., <strong>Dijkstra’s Algorithm</strong>)</li>
            <li><strong>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)</strong></li>

    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Dijkstra’s Algorithm in Traffic Management</h2>
        <p>Dijkstra’s Algorithm is an essential tool used to find the <strong>shortest path</strong> between nodes in a graph, which can represent intersections and roads in a city’s traffic network. It calculates the most efficient route for vehicles to minimize travel time and congestion, adapting dynamically based on real-time conditions such as traffic volume, accidents, or road closures.</p>

        <h3>Applications of Dijkstra’s Algorithm in Traffic Management</h3>

        <div class="section-title">1. Real-Time Route Optimization for Vehicles</div>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Help drivers find the most efficient route to their destination.</p>
        <p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The road network is modeled as a graph, where intersections are nodes, and road segments are edges weighted by distance or time.</li>
            <li>The algorithm computes the shortest path for vehicles based on real-time data (e.g., traffic congestion or accidents).</li>
            <li>GPS systems or traffic management apps guide drivers to the best routes, avoiding congestion and delays.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Reduces travel time, lowers congestion, and improves overall traffic flow.</p>

        <div class="section-title">2. Emergency Vehicle Route Optimization</div>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Ensure emergency vehicles (ambulances, fire trucks, police) reach their destinations quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emergency vehicles are given higher priority in the algorithm, allowing for the fastest route calculation.</li>
            <li>The algorithm adjusts traffic signals or clears congested routes to prioritize emergency vehicles.</li>
            <li>Real-time data about traffic congestion, accidents, and road conditions are incorporated into the calculations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Reduces emergency response times, enhancing public safety.</p>

        <div class="section-title">3. Traffic Signal Optimization</div>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Optimize traffic light timings to ensure smooth flow at intersections.</p>
        <p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each intersection is modeled as a node, and traffic flow between them is dynamically adjusted based on real-time data.</li>
            <li>Dijkstra’s algorithm calculates which lanes should be prioritized by adjusting the light timings, reducing wait times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Minimizes congestion, reduces idle time, and lowers fuel consumption.</p>

        <div class="section-title">4. Adaptive Traffic Flow Management at Intersections</div>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Prevent gridlocks and improve the efficiency of high-traffic intersections.</p>
        <p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traffic flow is continually monitored using sensors and cameras, updating the graph for Dijkstra’s algorithm.</li>
            <li>The algorithm dynamically prioritizes lanes and adjusts traffic light timings at complex intersections.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Improved traffic throughput, reduced delays, and efficient use of road infrastructure.</p>
