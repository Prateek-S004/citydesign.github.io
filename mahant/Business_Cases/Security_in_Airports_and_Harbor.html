    <h1>Security in Airports and Harbor</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Water docks and airports are critical infrastructure that require advanced security measures. By leveraging optimized surveillance and threat detection, the city can ensure the safety of people, goods, and operations, making it a secure hub for travel and trade.</p>
        
        <div class="section-title">SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Target 11.5:</strong> Significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations</li>
            <li><strong>Indicator 11.5.3:</strong> Damage to critical infrastructure and number of disruptions to basic services, attributed to disasters.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="section-title">Objectives</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement advanced monitoring and communication infrastructure for real-time security.</li>
            <li>Establish environmentally safe waste collection and recycling facilities across docks and airports.</li>
            <li>Use air and water purification systems to prevent contamination at key infrastructure points.</li>
            <li>Adhere to strict eco-friendly regulations, ensuring sustainable operations across all facilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-title">Benefits</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces vulnerabilities and ensures the safety of assets, personnel, and travelers.</li>
            <li>Minimizes the number of security resources (eg: cameras, personnel) required without compromising coverage.</li>
            <li>Enables faster detection and resolution of security incidents through optimized patrol paths and real-time threat assessment.</li>
            <li>Avoids unnecessary security overhead by prioritizing high-risk areas.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-title">Algorithm Used</div>
        <p>To ensure proper security in airports and ship docks, <a href="https://github.com/Prateek-S004/citydesign.github.io/blob/main/mahant/Codes/BFSS.cpp" title="View BFSS on GitHub">BFSS(brute force string search)</a> can be used to search for valid PAN number and take actions accordingly.</p>
