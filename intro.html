            <h2>Problem Space and How It Was Arrived At</h2>

<p><b>Vyomadri</b>, our smart city project, was conceptualized to create a city that is not just infrastructure-efficient but also functionally smart. To achieve this, we identified key problem areas based on current urban challenges and futuristic demands.
    The goal was to ensure seamless functioning, improve quality of life, and generate sustainable revenue streams.</p>

<p>By analyzing these challenges and referencing the insights provided by the white paper authored by Prakash Hegde, we recognized the need to blend innovative urban planning with data-driven solutions.
    The problem space was mapped considering essential factors like traffic management, tourism, food production, public transport, technology, and community well-being.</p>

     <h2>Findings from the White Paper</h2>

    <h3>Urban Dynamics and Street Life</h3>
    <p>The paper highlights that every city has unique dynamics shaped by its streets, people, and culture. Inspired by Mumbai’s vibrant street life, Vyomadri will incorporate art, culture, and public spaces that reflect the city’s residents and their dynamic urban life.</p>

    <h3>City Design and Smart Cities</h3>
    <p>Drawing lessons from Matheran’s vehicle-free model, the paper emphasizes that smart cities should prioritize sustainability over mere technological advancements. Vyomadri will integrate pollution-free systems, cultural heritage, and environmental sustainability, redefining the traditional concept of smart cities.</p>

    <h3>Commuting and City Connectivity</h3>
    <p>Inspired by Mumbai’s local trains, the paper stresses the importance of efficient and affordable public transport. Vyomadri will focus on sustainable commuting systems that are eco-friendly, efficient, and affordable, addressing the challenges of large urban populations.</p>

    <h3>Questions for Reflection and Need Statements</h3>
    <p>The paper poses critical questions, such as how to build affordable and sustainable commuting systems while balancing development with environmental and social considerations. These reflections guide Vyomadri’s infrastructure and design strategies.</p>

    <h3>Algorithmic Thinking and Urban Solutions</h3>
    <p>The importance of computational thinking and algorithms in solving urban challenges is underscored in the paper. Vyomadri will implement data-driven smart city services, such as utilities and digital platforms, ensuring real-time solutions for residents and businesses.</p>
