    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This case focuses on optimizing park and school accessibility for families within residential zones.</p>

    <div class="technique">
        <h3>BFS for Graph Traversal</h3>
        <p>The BFS technique is used to traverse the adjacency matrix of residential zones, parks, and schools. This helps in finding the shortest path between different zones and facilities like schools and parks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Useful for determining proximity of different zones to facilities.</li>
            <li>Ensures efficient navigation and allocation of resources across multiple zones.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="advantage">
            <strong>Advantages:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (zones) and E is the number of edges (connections).</li>
                <li>Works well for large graphs and helps efficiently find the shortest path in unweighted graphs.</li>
                <li>Fast traversal in terms of space complexity as it uses only a queue for exploration.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="technique">
        <h3>Greedy Optimization for Resource Allocation</h3>
        <p>The greedy technique is applied to prioritize zones with higher population densities. This helps in allocating resources like parks and schools to the most populated zones first.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maximizes the impact of resource allocation by focusing on the areas with the greatest need.</li>
            <li>Helps ensure that densely populated areas have the necessary facilities for family well-being.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="advantage">
            <strong>Advantages:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Time Complexity: O(n log n) when sorting zones by population density, where n is the number of zones.</li>
                <li>Efficiently allocates resources in a way that guarantees optimal results in less time.</li>
                <li>Simple and easy to implement, with a direct approach to maximize resource usage.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Business Case 2: A Hub for Knowledge Sharing and Workforce Training</h2>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This case aims to assign trainers and schedule training sessions based on the requests and available capacity of the training centers.</p>

    <div class="technique">
        <h3>First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling</h3>
        <p>The FCFS scheduling technique assigns training sessions based on their arrival order. It helps in organizing the training sessions and allocating them without conflict.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple to implement and ensures that training requests are handled in the order they arrive.</li>
            <li>Helps manage training center resources effectively by ensuring no session overlap.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="advantage">
            <strong>Advantages:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of training requests.</li>
                <li>Works quickly as each request is processed in the order it arrives.</li>
                <li>Optimal for low-complexity scheduling where session conflicts are minimal.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="technique">
        <h3>Greedy Resource Allocation</h3>
        <p>The greedy technique is used to allocate trainers to centers with the highest demand. It optimizes resource usage by ensuring that the most requested skills are addressed first.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Optimizes trainer utilization by focusing on the centers with the most significant demand.</li>
            <li>Helps balance the distribution of available trainers across training centers.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="advantage">
            <strong>Advantages:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Time Complexity: O(n log n) when sorting the training requests or centers by demand.</li>
                <li>Minimizes idle time for trainers, ensuring they are used where demand is highest.</li>
                <li>Greedy nature ensures fast allocation of resources without backtracking.</li>
            </ul>
